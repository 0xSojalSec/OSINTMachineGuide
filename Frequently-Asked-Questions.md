## Can I apply the recommendations on a Windows HOST?

Unfortunately not. Commercial systems like Windows and Apple focus on profit in their operating systems. To generate profit, meeting the desires of investors is necessary. Consequently, these systems collect mass data and use it for marketing policies, in addition to selling this data to business groups. These groups also aim to understand user actions to create increasingly personalized products. Moreover, Windows, for example, has thousands of vulnerabilities and CVEs without efficient solutions, widely exploited by individuals with advanced knowledge. For this reason, Kicksecure was built to operate on Debian.
