<h1>Host Operating System</h1>

A host operating system, also known as a host OS, serves as the primary operating system in a computing environment. Its primary function is to manage the computer’s physical resources and provide support for various operations, including the execution of virtual machines.

In a virtualized environment, the computer’s physical resources, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and networking, are abstracted to a higher level. This enables the simultaneous execution of multiple operating systems, termed guest operating systems, on the same physical hardware.

The host operating system assumes the responsibility of managing these resources and facilitating guest operating systems’ access to the required physical resources. Additionally, it plays a critical role in ensuring that guest operating systems function independently without interfering with each other’s operations.

<strong>Examples of host operating systems include</strong>:

* KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
* XenServer
* Proxmox Virtual Environment
* Citrix Hypervisor
* Red Hat Virtualization

In a virtualized environment, the host operating system plays a crucial role in the efficient and secure operation of virtual machines. It establishes the essential infrastructure for the smooth and secure execution of guest operating systems.

However, in the pursuit of a more secure environment for our OSINT application, it is essential to consider aspects of digital security. Solutions like Qubes and Linux Kicksecure stand out for this purpose.

Qubes, theoretically, is designed to provide enhanced security due to its more robust design. However, its use may require a more advanced level of cybersecurity expertise, and it faces hardware limitations, as it is not compatible with all hardware setups.

As an alternative, the team that developed Qubes also created Kicksecure, a system that is simpler to use and understand and offers a significant security enhancement.

Therefore, to achieve the required level of security for our OSINT operations, the chosen option is Linux Kicksecure. However, it is important to recognize that implementation requires an intricate setup process.

The <strong>Kicksecure Project</strong> describes the system as: <em>“Kicksecure is a free and open-source Linux distribution that aims to provide a highly secure computing environment. It has been developed from the ground up according to a formidable — and time proven — defense in-depth security design. In the default configuration, Kicksecure provides superior layered defenses of protection from many types of Malware.

Kicksecure is a complete desktop operating system designed. Numerous applications come pre-installed with safe defaults which can be used immediately upon installation with minimal user input.”</em>
