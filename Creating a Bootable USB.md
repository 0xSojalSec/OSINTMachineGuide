<h1>Creating a Bootable USB Drive (Using Ventoy)</h1>

<h2>Installing Ventoy on Windows, Linux, and macOS:</h2>

<strong>Download Ventoy</strong>: Visit the official Ventoy website at <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/" target="_blank"> and download the version suitable for your system (Windows, Linux, or macOS). </a> 

<strong>Extract the File</strong>: After downloading, extract the ZIP file contents to a folder on your computer.

<strong>Connect the USB Drive</strong>: Insert the USB drive you want to use with Ventoy into your computer.

<strong>Run the Installer</strong>: Within the Ventoy folder you extracted, locate the appropriate executable file for your system (for example, “Ventoy2Disk.exe” for Windows, “VentoyGUI.x86_64” for Linux and macOS).


In Linux, for instance, I referred to the file VentoyGUI.x86_64 as it’s the architecture of my computer, you should choose the file that represents your architecture.

<strong>Install Ventoy on the USB Drive</strong>: Open the installer and select the USB drive where you want to install Ventoy. Make sure to choose the correct drive as all data on it will be erased. Click the ‘Install’ button or execute the corresponding command.

<strong>Copy ISO Files</strong>: After the installation is complete, copy the ISO files of Linux distributions or operating systems directly to the USB drive.


Remember in the previous step you downloaded the Debian Netinst from the Debian website? It’s this file that you’re going to copy into your USB drive where you just installed Ventoy.


<strong>Start from the USB Drive</strong>: Now you can restart your computer, select the USB drive as the boot device, and choose which operating system or distribution to start from the Ventoy menu.


Now you’ll need to restart your computer (ensure the first boot option is the USB drive).
