Welcome to our repository dedicated to enhancing the security of your journalistic investigations and open-source intelligence (OSINT) sources. In a scenario where powerful adversaries are constantly undermining our investigations, the implementation of appropriate security measures becomes crucial. Many investigators overlook the dangers associated with the use of vulnerable machines (computers/notebooks), exposing themselves to significant risks.

When investigating opponents with extensive resources, vast knowledge, and unlimited time, the vulnerability of your machine is an imminent threat. Invasion can result in devastating losses, from the destruction or alteration of your research to obtaining confidential data from sources, putting lives at risk. Additionally, your work and reputation can be destroyed in an instant.

In this repository, you will also find a basic security approach for your team. We then delve into digital security with a comprehensive guide that includes enhanced protection measures. We avoid the use of vulnerable machines by implementing advanced system strengthening techniques, configuring firewalls, installing rotating proxies, and system hardening to prevent major attacks.

Protect the integrity of your research and the security of your sources at no cost. Don't risk it with standard solutions; choose the unparalleled security we offer. Maintain the confidentiality of your investigations with our step-by-step guide and expertise in digital security.

<h2 id="">Important Note: </h2>

To follow along with this tutorial, we assume that you have already installed Debian on your computer (the machine you will use for your investigations or the machine/HD where you will test this tutorial).

It is crucial to note that if you are not familiar with installing Debian on your own, you may not be ready to proceed with this tutorial. I'm not saying you won't be able to do it, especially because, after the installation, the subsequent steps involve simply copying from my tutorial and pasting into your terminal, making the process easier. In my understanding, the installation is the most complex part, as you can't just copy and paste like in the other steps of this article.
<br><br>
> THE GOOD NEWS IS, IF YOU CAN INSTALL DEBIAN, THE REST IS SIMPLE - JUST COPY AND PASTE INTO YOUR TERMINAL...
<br><br>
<h2 id="post-debian-instalation">Initial Preparation After Debian Installation</h2>

Open a terminal and execute the following command:

    su

Install the sudo and adduser packages:

    apt update

  Note: It’s possible the terminal may generate an error and not update; if this happens, follow the next 2 steps below.

    sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

Erase whatever is there and paste the code below:

    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware
    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware

    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main non-free-firmware
    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main non-free-firmware

    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmware
    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmwar

Press ctrl + O to save
Press Enter
Press ctrl + X to exit

Note: If the update error doesn’t occur, ignore the above procedure and continue to the command below:

    apt full-upgrade

    apt install --no-install-recommends sudo adduser

Create a group called ‘console’:

    /usr/sbin/addgroup --system console

Add your Linux username to the ‘console’ group. Be sure to replace ‘user’ with your actual username (or your sock puppet’s):

    /usr/sbin/adduser user console

Add the user ‘user’ to the ‘sudo’ group. Depending on your level of experience, follow the appropriate instructions:

    /usr/sbin/adduser user sudo

Restart the system:

    /sbin/reboot

<h2 id="instalacao-tor">Installing and Configuring the Tor Browser</h2>
  
Open the terminal and type:

    sudo apt update

After the update, enter the following command:

Download the APT Signing Key:

    wget https://www.kicksecure.com/keys/derivative.asc

Users can check the Signing Key for better security.

Add the APT Signing Key:

    sudo cp ~/derivative.asc /usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc

Add the derivative repository:

    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc] https://deb.kicksecure.com bookworm main contrib non-free" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/derivative.list

Update your package lists:

    sudo apt-get update

   Mark the package for installation by right-clicking or checking the box to the left of the name.
   Click ‘Apply’ to start the installation process.
   <strong>Install the following applications: Zulucrypt, Bleachbit, Kleopatra and OnionShare.</strong>

<h2 id="procedimentos-morfing1">Installation/Procedure for Morphing (Linux Hardening)</h2>

It is necessary to install the “curl” package.

To do so, follow steps below:

Update the package list:

    sudo apt update

Update the system:

    sudo apt full-upgrade

Install the “curl” package. The use of the — no-install-recommends parameter with the apt command is, in most cases, optional.

    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends curl

Done.

The installation procedure for “curl” has been completed.

Download the Kicksecure signature key and add it to the system with the following commands:

    sudo torsocks curl --output /usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc --url http://www.w5j6stm77zs6652pgsij4awcjeel3eco7kvipheu6mtr623eyyehj4yd.onion/keys/derivative.asc

Done.

Add the Repository

Add the Kicksecure APT Repository.

Choose Option A; there are three options as listed below, and we will choose Option A as it is the most secure.

A: Onion Repository<br>
B: Clearnet Repository via Tor<br>
C: Clearnet Repository<br>

Option A: Add the Kicksecure Onion Repository.

To add the Kicksecure Repository via Onion, install the “apt-transport-tor” package from the Debian repository.

    sudo apt install apt-transport-tor

Next, add the Kicksecure APT Repository to the default Kicksecure, using the stable Debian (at the time of writing, it was “bookworm”):

    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/derivative.asc] tor+http://deb.w5j6stm77zs6652pgsij4awcjeel3eco7kvipheu6mtr623eyyehj4yd.onion bookworm main contrib non-free" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/derivative.list

Done.

## Install the Kicksecure Package

Choose a Kicksecure package.

> <strong>CLI Version</strong>: Exclusive command-line interface (CLI) version. This version does not modify the graphical environment of the system. It provides kernel enhancement, increased entropy, and other security features."

> <strong>GUI Version</strong>: Similar to the CLI version, but installs the Xfce graphical environment and default applications. Useful if Debian was installed without a graphical environment, and you want the Kicksecure graphical environment (Xfce). This is the one we will choose!!"

For host operating systems: kicksecure-xfce-host

Install a Kicksecure package, such as “kicksecure-xfce-host.”

To do this, follow steps below:

Update the package list:

    sudo apt update

Update the system:

    sudo apt full-upgrade

Install the “kicksecure-xfce-host” package.

The use of the --no-install-recommends parameter with the apt command is, in most cases, optional.

    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-xfce-host

Wait for it to complete.

Done.


## Post-Installation

Move the original file “/etc/apt/sources.list” to a temporary location (or delete it) as it will be replaced by “/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list” from Kicksecure:

    sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list ~/

Configure the onionized Debian repositories. Open the file “/etc/apt/sources.list” with the text editor “nano” and replace the existing content with the following:

    sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list

![1-UVgVqpkX7q6-D2_fTuubGQ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*UVgVqpkX7q6-D2_fTuubGQ.png)

<em>An file like this will appear; take note of the green lines. If yours doesn’t have green lines, simply go to the beginning of the line and remove the # (also known as uncommenting the line).</em>

If you don’t find it in your file, just copy the lines below, paste them into the file, and save.

    deb tor+https://fasttrack.debian.net/debian bookworm-fasttrack main contrib non-free

    deb tor+http://2s4yqjx5ul6okpp3f2gaunr2syex5jgbfpfvhxxbbjwnrsvbk5v3qbid.onion/debian bookworm main contrib non-free

<em>If it appears like this screen, it means the onionization has worked.</em>

<h2 id="configurando-firewall">Installing and Configuring the Firewall</h2>

To install GUFW, open the terminal and type the following command.

    sudo apt install gufw

This command will install the firewall. Once the installation is complete, go to the “Applications” menu, point to “Settings,” and in the submenu, click on “Firewall Configuration.”

It will open the following window:

![1-eTNCNQSUNXKA1aLpDA4f0Q](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*eTNCNQSUNXKA1aLpDA4f0Q.png)

#### Enable the Profile:

Click on “Status” to activate the profile.

#### Incoming and Outgoing:

Mark both as “Deny” to block all incoming and outgoing traffic.

#### Access Rules:

Click on “Rules.”

#### Add a Rule:

In the bottom-left corner, when pointing the mouse, click on the “+” sign that will appear as “Add a rule…”

#### Rule Type:

Click on “Simple.”

#### Outgoing Configuration:

Select “Outgoing” and choose the “Allow” option.

#### Set the Direction:

In “Direction,” select “Out” (do not change the other options).

#### Add the allowed services and their associated ports:

- “Name”: DNS, “Port”: 53 —Click on “+ Add”.
- “Name”: HTTP, “Port”: 80 — Click on “+ Add”.
- “Name”: HTTPS, “Port”: 443 — Click on “+ Add”.
- “Name”: PRIVOXY, “Port”: 8118 — Click on “+ Add”.
- “Name”: TOR, “Port”: 9050 — Click on “+ Add”.

Done, 

Your firewall is configured with the defined rules, it should look like the image below:


![1-viMriGXe189UefamnoubmQ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*viMriGXe189UefamnoubmQ.png)

Click on the X to close GUFW.

#### To enable the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) at system startup, you can use the following command:

    sudo systemctl enable ufw

### Restart your computer.

During the boot screen, you will notice a change; you should see something similar to the image below:

![1-sWsvq2Mrn-oNwFTqkHvdHQ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*sWsvq2Mrn-oNwFTqkHvdHQ.png)

Note that now GRUB displays text related to Kicksecure and no longer to Debian. Also, observe that there is an option “LIVE mode USER (For daily activities.)” Soon we will see how to use this option. For now, keep the option “Kicksecure GNU/Linux” selected.

Wait for the system to start, log in with your user.


<h2 id="tor-e-privoxy">Tor Service and Privoxy Configuration (Step by Step)</h2>

Installation of Tor and Privoxy:

Install Tor and Privoxy with the following commands:

Note: Since you installed the Kicksecure Package, the Tor Service was automatically installed by default. However, to confirm, simply enter the following command in the terminal:

    sudo tor --version

![1-gSVyHJ3gdLFoXeLCHHhZoA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*gSVyHJ3gdLFoXeLCHHhZoA.png)

An interface similar to this should appear, displaying the Tor Service version and additional information.

If it doesn’t appear, you will have to install it with the command below:

    sudo apt install tor

Now install Privoxy with the command below:

    sudo apt install privoxy

Tor and Privoxy Configuration:

Enable the Tor service to start automatically with the system:

    sudo systemctl enable tor

Enable the Privoxy service to start automatically with the system:

    sudo systemctl enable privoxy

Configure Privoxy to forward connections to Tor:

Open the Privoxy configuration file in a text editor, such as Nano:

    sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config

Locate the line containing “forward-socks5” and remove the “#” at the beginning of the line to uncomment it.

![1 kT3tcY06eRasWUZanBFHug](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*kT3tcY06eRasWUZanBFHug.png)

<em>As shown in this image, be persistent, as it may take some time to locate this line.</em>

Save the changes by pressing Ctrl + O to save, confirm with Enter, and press Ctrl + X to Exit.

Start the Tor and Privoxy services:

    sudo systemctl start tor && sudo systemctl start privoxy

If necessary, restart the services:

    sudo systemctl restart tor

    sudo systemctl restart privoxy

DNS Configuration:

Open the DNS configuration file in a text editor, such as Nano:

    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

Remove all existing lines and add the following lines to configure the DNS servers (use DNS servers of your preference if desired):

    nameserver 9.9.9.9
    nameserver 149.112.112.112

Save the changes to the file.

Protect the DNS configuration file against accidental modifications:

    sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

Restart the services:

    sudo systemctl restart tor

    sudo systemctl restart privoxy

Now let’s configure the proxy on the system. Some people prefer to set it up in the browser, but I prefer to apply it system-wide. For this, I recommend installing the Gnome-Control-Panel, which is an intuitive tool.

Open the terminal and type the following command:

    sudo apt update

    sudo apt install gnome-control-center

Once it completes the installation, continue in the terminal and type:

    gnome-control-center

A screen will appear as below:

![1-7TfUS5slZD2vLUpfrzWqEA](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*7TfUS5slZD2vLUpfrzWqEA.png)


Go to “Network Proxy” and click on the “gear” icon for settings.

![1-OrkC8A7Z1S13_KB0JLIX8Q](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*OrkC8A7Z1S13_KB0JLIX8Q.png)


- HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1 — Port: 8118

- HTTPS Proxy: 127.0.0.1 — Port: 8118

- Socks Host: 127.0.0.1 — Port: 9050

- gnore Hosts: localhost, 127.0.0.0/8, ::1


Now, as shown in the image above, configure your computer settings. When you finish, close the windows by clicking on the X.

Open Firefox and type: dnsleaktest.com

You should see an IP different from yours, meaning it’s not from your ISP.

![1-D3mezMjAQOZcDXmY9lfgmg](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*D3mezMjAQOZcDXmY9lfgmg.png)


<em>Note: Some people don’t like to use a proxy in countries of the 5 or 14 Eyes, but don’t worry, you are an investigator for good and in the service of justice, so the <strong> NSA</strong>  won’t come after you unless you are threatening U.S. security (laughs). Oh, and remember that Privoxy is rotating, meaning every few minutes, you can refresh this page, and a new IP address will appear.</em>

<h2 id="gerenciador-de-senhas">Password Manager</h2>

## Open KeePassXC

<a href="https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide" target="_blank">[User manual link for KeePassXC. Click Here.]</a>

Launch KeePassXC on your computer.

#### Create a New Database

In the main menu, click on “File” and select “New Database.”

#### Choose the Location and Name of the Database

Select where you want to save the database and give it a name. Remember to choose a secure location.

#### Set a Strong Password

Create a strong password for your database. I recommend using a password generated by a password generator like Diceware. Ensure the password is long, unique, and includes special characters. [<a href="https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide" target="_blank">[User manual link for KeePassXC. Click Here.]</a>


#### Securely Store the Password

As suggested, it’s a good practice to write the password on paper and store it in a secure location until you memorize it. Make sure this paper is in a private place.

#### Complete the Database Creation

After entering the password, click on “Create Database” to complete the process.

#### Start Adding Passwords

Now that the database is created, begin adding your passwords and important information to KeePassXC.

Click on “Entries” and then “New Entry…”

Simply follow the steps.

Remember, the security of your database heavily depends on the strength of the master password. Ensure to protect it properly.
