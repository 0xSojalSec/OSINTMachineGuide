<h1>Important Considerations About the Operating System</h1>

Windows is globally used, offering ease of use and familiarity for most users. However, its popularity also makes it a constant target for malicious actors, resulting in frequent vulnerabilities and attacks. Due to its commercial nature and focus on software delivery speed, security often isn’t the primary priority. Additionally, Microsoft’s business model emphasizes data collection for marketing and advertising purposes.

In a scenario where security and privacy are of utmost importance, high-level teams should dedicate themselves to exploring systems that prioritize these aspects. This is where Linux distributions come into play, some of which are specifically designed with a primary focus on security and privacy from their conception.

For the purposes of this article and tutorial, where we’re constructing a host machine resistant to determined adversaries, we’ve opted for a Linux distribution.

But don’t worry: the transition can be conducted with ease as the step-by-step process is intuitive and well-detailed.

<h2>Kicksecure Inside Debian</h2>

In this guide, I will provide a detailed explanation of the process of installing the Kicksecure system on Debian, also known as “Distribution Morphing,” which is the transformation of one Linux distribution into another.

The objective is to strengthen and protect the system against a wide range of cyber threats, as mentioned earlier.

Kicksecure addresses a variety of security concerns, including:

* <strong>Advanced Security Features, including entropy</strong>: Improved security through random number generators for enhanced unpredictability.

* <strong>Live Mode</strong>: Secure operation in a temporary environment where data is erased upon session closure.

* <strong>Onion Network Browsing (Tor)</strong>: Facilitating secure and anonymous browsing through the Tor network for enhanced connection protection.

* <strong>User Account Separation</strong>: Strengthening user account isolation within the system.

* <strong>Console Lockdown</strong>: Disabling obsolete login methods for enhanced security.

* <strong>Swap File</strong>: Implementing encrypted swap files to mitigate security risks associated with RAM.

* And many more.
