<h1>Initial System Setup</h1>

Before we continue our journey, it’s important to clarify that: First, we’ll download and install the Debian Operating System, and Second, we’ll undergo the Morphing process, transforming Debian into a security-hardened operating system by default. Its primary mission is to mitigate most of the security problems faced today.

<strong>Note</strong>: This ‘paranoid’ level, for some, is indeed necessary because we’re talking about an investigation into hostile governments with unlimited resources. Governments that have a history of hacking other governments worldwide, including various instances where they even hacked the government of the United States of America.

Therefore, our journey begins now, with the mission of having an extremely secure HOST computer for our investigations.
